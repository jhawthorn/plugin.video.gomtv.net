About
====================
This is a video addon for gomtv.net for xbmc.

Features
====================
* Browsing of Most recent/Most viewed/Most commented vods
* Playback of vods
* Live watching (hopefully)

Installing
====================
* Download [plugin.video.gomtv.net-0.0.5.zip](https://bitbucket.org/henrik/plugin.video.gomtv.net/downloads/plugin.video.gomtv.net-0.0.5.zip)
* Start xbmc and navigate to system -> add-ons -> install from zip file, browse to the file.
* Configure the add-on by navigating to system -> add-ons -> enabled addons -> video add-ons -> gomtv.net -> configure
* You're done! Use the add-on from the add-ons item in the video-browser.

Known issues
====================
* After starting to watch a vod (and probably livestream too), you can't watch it again unless you
  go to the previous directory and then back again. This is because the urls that are generated have
  a one-time key.
